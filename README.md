This program converts a bitstream generated by a Bernoulli process with unknown `p` into a bitstream generated by a Bernoulli process with `p = 0.5`.
In other words: the program removes (unknown) bias.

The program works in a streaming fashion, e.g. on a (theoretically) infinite bitstream and achieves the theoretically optimal result (if the state tree can grow indefinitely).
This contrasts e.g. [Von Neumanns well-known extractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_extractor#Von_Neumann_extractor). 

This program is a partial implementation of a paper titled "Streaming Algorithms for Optimal Generation of Random Bits", authored by Hongchao Zhou and Jehoshua Bruck.
